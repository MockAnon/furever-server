<h2>Domestic Short Hair Cat Personality</h2>
<p>Much like her color and pattern varieties, the Domestic shorthair cat personality spans a vast territory. Domestics can
  be playful, affectionate, quiet, vocal, docile, or calmâ€”but are often social, points out Trupanion. She is not an aggressive
  cat by nature, which makes her a terrific companion for children and seniors, and, with a proper introduction period, she's
  a great playmate for cats, dogs and other pets.</p>
<p>The Domestic Shorthair is considered a working cat because of her endurance skills, such as balancing and leaping, as
  well as her superb hunting instinct. These characteristics are often reflected in her playful personality.</p>
<p>She'll need an outlet for all this energy, so provide her with a safe perch from which she can observe the great outdoors
  <p>She'll need an outlet for all this energy, so provide her with a safe perch from which she can observe the great outdoors
    and practice her balance and agility skills. She'll want to keep an eye on the birds in the garden and on her pet parents
    in the living room at the same time. With her keen sense of surroundings, the Domestic also knows when it's a good time
    to curl up in the nearest available lap for an afternoon snooze.</p>

  <h2>Domestic Short Hair Cat Traits</h2>
  <p>The Domestic shorthair comes in a wide array of colors, sizes, and statures, though they tend to be medium-sized and
    muscular. They have short, sleek coats and round heads and paws. Because of their mixed parentage, Domestic Shorthairs
    don't tend to be at-risk for any unusual health complications.</p>
  <p>Animal Planet affectionately refers to Domestic shorthair cats as the mutts of the cat world because they're a mix of
    various breeds, resulting in a vast range of markings, colors, and personalities. With endless color and pattern combinations,
    they are a rainbow of cat cuddles.
  </p>
  <p>Generally speaking, she falls into the medium category for height and weight, and much like her purebred, pedigreed
    relative, the American shorthair, the Domestic shorthair cat has a muscular build with a round face and eyes. Because
    she is of mixed ancestry, a Domestic may also be smaller or larger in stature, depending on her genetic makeup.</p>
  <p>The World Cat Federation (WCF) notes that Domestics should have a balanced, solid body structure, with a head, nose,
    and ears that are proportionate to her body. But, as a trip to your local shelter will confirm, household cats come in
    many shapes and sizes.</p>

  <h2>Domestic Medium Hair Cat Personality</h2>
  <p>Like Domestic Longhairs and Domestic Shorthairs, Domestic Medium Hairs have a diverse gene pool and can consist of a
    variety of different breeds mixed into one cat. Therefore, their temperaments and personalities range widely from super
    affectionate to independent, and really talkative or active to very quiet, laidback, and docile.</p>
  <p>On a whole, though, you can expect Domestic Medium Hairs to make great pets, and they will fit in well in any cat loving
    family. Many will get along wonderfully with children and other pets, including other cats.</p>
  <p>You should expect that Domestic Medium Hairs will be playful and rambunctious kittens, but they tend to mellow out with
    age. Properly socialized when they are young, Domestic Medium Hairs will make great lifelong companions.</p>

  <h2>Domestic Medium Hair Cat Traits</h2>
  <p>Again, like Domestic Shorthairs and Domestic Longhairs, Domestic Medium Hairs come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and
    facial expressions, depending upon the breeds that make up their ancestry. For example, some cats may be lean and long,
    while others may be short and stocky. Generally, though, females tend to be smaller than males.</p>
  <p>The main feature that all Domestic Medium Hairs have in common is their luxuriously soft and beautiful double coat.
    Also, these cats are not as common as their Domestic Shorthair counterparts.</p>

  <h2>Domestic Long Hair Cat Personality</h2>
  <p>These great looking cats have equally great dispositions, but because they are not considered a single breed and have
    a diverse gene pool, they can have a range of personalities. Overall, though, they are friendly, social, playful, loving,
    intelligent, and loyal companions that do well in just about any home. Some, however, may be quiet and shy, while others
    can be aloof or independent.
  </p>
  <p>Domestic Longhairs can also be easy to train, can have a lot of energy, are affectionate towards their owners, and are
    usually also quite open to meeting strangers. These cats are even known for being quite talkative with their favorite
    human companions.

  <h2>Domestic Long Hair Cat Traits</h2>
  <p>The Domestic Longhair is basically a Domestic Shorthair with fancier, longer fur. The long fur gene is recessive, though,
    so only about 1 in every 10 cats will be a longhaired cat, making these felines more rare than their shorthaired counterparts.</p>
  <p>The medium to long fur can range from 2 to 6 inches in length. And if a Domestic Longhair also has a neck ruff, it will
    make his head look even broader than it really is. Foot and ear tufts are also possible on some Domestic Longhairs.</p>
  <p>Like their personalities, the physical features of a Domestic Longhair can vary considerably, depending upon the breeds
    and genes in an individual cats ancestry. This is why Domestic Longhairs come in a range of sizes, shapes, body types,
    and facial expressions.</p>
